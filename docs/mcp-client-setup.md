## Understanding the Configuration

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration in the MCP Client is defined through a JSON structure that
specifies how the client should connect to and interact with MCP servers. Here's a comprehensive description:

### Configuration Structure

The MCP server configuration is defined in a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ServerName": {
      "command": "executable",
      "args": [
        "arg1",
        "arg2"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Fields

1. **ServerName** (string, required)
    - A user-defined name for the MCP server (e.g., "Swarm")
    - Appears in the UI to identify the server
2. **command** (string, required)
    - The command to execute to start the MCP server
    - Common values: "node", "python", or a direct path to an executable (e.g. "npx" or "uv")
3. **args** (array of strings, optional)
    - Command-line arguments to pass to the command
    - Typically includes the path to the server script
    - Example: ["/path/to/your/server.js"]
4. **env** (object, optional)
    - Environment variables to set when starting the server
    - Useful for configuration that shouldn't be hardcoded
    - Example: {"BEE_API_URL": "url-to-bee-node"}

#### Swarm-specific Environment Variables

1. **BEE_API_URL** (string, optional)
    - The URL of the Bee API endpoint
    - If omitted, it will fall back to the default Swarm Gateway
    - Example: "http://localhost:1633"
2. **BEE_BATCH_ID** (string, optional)
    - The ID of the postage stamp batch to use for uploads
    - If the batch ID is not provided, the Swarm Gateway will use its own postage stamp batch
    - If a custom _BEE_API_URL_ is provided, this field becomes **required**
    - Example: "batch-123"
3. **BEE_FEED_PK** (string, optional)
    - The private key of the Swarm Feed to use
    - If the private key is not provided, the Swarm Feed related functionalities **will not work**

## Setting up MCP Clients

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop is a desktop application that can be used to interact with Claude AI models.

#### Setup

1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Open Claude Desktop
3. Click "Get Stated" and then do Sign In (note: a free account is sufficient)
4. Under your profile, access "Settings"
5. Go to the "Developer" tab and see the "Local MCP servers" section
6. Click "Edit Config"
7. A window locating the _claude_desktop_config.json_ will pop-up
8. Open _claude_desktop_config.json_ for editing
9. Add the following to _claude_desktop_config.json_:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Swarm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "/location/to/your/swarm-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

10. Save the _claude_desktop_config.json_ file
11. Restart Claude Desktop

#### Verify MCP is running

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Under your profile, access "Settings"
3. Go to the "Developer" tab and see the "Local MCP servers" section
4. You should see the "Swarm" MCP server listed there
5. It should be highlighted with "running" status

#### Controlling accessibility of MCP tools

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Under your profile, access "Settings"
3. Go to the "Connectors" tab and see the "Connectors" section
4. You should see the "Swarm" MCP server listed there (highlighted as "LOCAL DEV" mode)
5. Click "Configure"
6. You can use the toggles to disable/enable individual tools to be available to Claude
7. You can set individual tools to "Always ask permission" (the default) or "Allow unsupervised" when being used

_Note_: You can verify the MCP server version on the configuration panel as highlighted in the header under the "Swarm"
name (e.g. _swarm-mcp-server v0.1.0_)

#### Troubleshooting

You can refer to this Claud Desktop setup guide on
the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#testing-your-server-with-claude-for-desktop)
site for more information.

### Windsurf

Windsurf is a code editor that can be used to edit code with real-time AI assistance and collaborative editing.

#### Setup

1. Download and install [Windsurf Editor](https://windsurf.com/download)
2. Open Windsurf
3. Sign in to Windsurf (note: a free account is sufficient)
4. Open Settings > Windsurf Settings
5. Go to the "Cascade" tab
6. Locate the "MCP Servers" section and click on "Manage MCPs"
7. Click "View raw config" on the top
8. Add the following to the config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Swarm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "/location/to/your/swarm-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

9. Save the config
10. Click "Refresh" on the top of "Manage MCPs"
11. You should see the "Swarm" MCP server listed there

_Note_: You can access the "Manage MCP servers" panel from "Cascade" too (see 'Verify MCP is running'
under [Windsurf](#windsurf))

#### Verify MCP is running

1. Open Windsurf
2. Open "Cascade" (using the icon at the top right)
3. Open the "MCP servers" (using the hammer icon beneath the "Ask anything" input)
4. The "Swarm" MCP should be listed there
5. It should be hihglighed with a green status if it is operational (and enabled)

_Note_: You can see the list of (enabled) MCP tools if you click on the "Swarm" MCP server name (the number of enabled
tools is also visible)

#### Controlling accessibility of MCP tools

1. Open Windsurf
2. Go to "Manage MCPs"
3. Select the "Swarm" MCP from the list
4. You can use the toggles to disable/enable individual tools to be available to the AI model
5. You can set the whole of the MCP disabled with the toggle opposite to the "Swarm" MCP name (displayed with an "
   Enabled" tag when enabled)

_Note_: You can view which individual tools are enabled on the "MCP Servers" tab of "Cascade" too (see 'Verify MCP is
running' under [Windsurf](#windsurf))
